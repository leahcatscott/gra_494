# Midterm Project

The first half of this semester will be dedicated to one project composed of multiple assignments. While this README file only contains the instructions for the first assignment, you will continue to receive new assignments and updated instructions via Canvas that will all apply to expanding this project. A General timeline is as follows:

| Weeks | Focus |
| -------- | ------- |
| 1-2 | Component Based Design |
| 3-4 | Templates & Page Design |
| 5-6 | Practical Javascript |
| 7-8 | Advanced CSS |

The overall goal of this project will be to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of front-end web design and the basics of front-end development. This should expand on the skills you gained in Technology for Design and greatly improve your ability to interface with web developers and software engineers on digital projects.

To begin this project, first clone this repository and merge it into the repository you created and shared with me the first day of class. I will continue to check your work on GitHub, so please be sure you are committing and pushing your work to GitHub on a regular basis.

## Getting Started

Our first step will be to focus on the concept of component based design and the atomic design system popularized by Brad Frost. If you are not already familiar with these concepts, [please review the basics here](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). You can also read Brad's entire book on the atomic design system [here](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/).

The premise of the atomic design system is to base your web designs on repeatable and reusable components rather than designing entire pages at a time. This ensures that your designs are consistent across multiple pages and make it as simple as possible for your ideas to be implemented, revised, and maintained by a developer.

To put these concepts into practice and demonstrate your understanding of them, please pick a website of your choice. You will then reverse engineer that site design and catalogue examples of atoms, molecules, and organisms present on that site. You can directly copy sections of the markup from your chosen site, but please keep all styles extremely minimal. All fonts can follow the default styles found in this repository and all colors should be greyscale. Add a brief description to each example in the structure provided within this project (see the `example-1.html` file in the atoms folder for guidance). If you don't know what website to choose, some great examples can be found at [awwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/).

## Atoms

Please find 7 examples of atoms for your site. Create one page for each example by copying the format/code found in the `example-1.html` file.

## Molecules

Please find 5 examples of molecules for your site. Ensure that they include at lest some of the atoms from the previous step. Create one page for each as you did previously.

## Organisms

Please find 3 examples of organisms for your site. Ensure that they include at lest one of the molecules from the previous step. Create one page for each as you did previously.

## Submission

Once you have finished your project, push all changes to your remote repository on GitHub and leave a comment on the 'Starting Your Midterm Project' discussion on Canvas notifying me that your work is ready for review.
